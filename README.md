# staffmonitoring
Nowadays there are so many occupations that need their staff to record their daily activities. It is use as a proof that the staff already finished their work. Staff usually need to sign a form at each checkpoint to record their activities for example the cleaner staff they need to sign a form after they finished  cleaning the toilet, room or office. At the end of the month the employer will check the sheet that has been sign by the staff. All the procedure were done manually. To keep track of the worker activities, I propose the design and implementation of a Staff Checkpoint Monitoring System (SCM) that can help both worker and employer. They are several problem that has been detected while using the manual system such as it takes time for the staff  to pull out the form that need to be sign. Other than that, the staff might mistakenly sign on the wrong column because of rushing. For employer, they need to collect every form that has been signed for record. There are possibilities that the form can be misplaced.  The objective of this system is to develop a system that can keep track the activities of the staff by using the Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) tag. They system will also allow the employer to check the record of their staff easily and it will cut the time consume for both staff and employer.
